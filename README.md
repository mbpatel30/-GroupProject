# A. Introduction to the project


**The goal of this blockchain project is to write a program that reads input data from a text file and creates a blockchain based on the provided data. All semester dates in the file are used to create blocks on the blockchain. A program will only accept a hash as valid if it meets certain conditions. Finally, the program will output the generated blockchain in a specific format.**Â
