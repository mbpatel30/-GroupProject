# A. Introduction to the project


**The goal of this blockchain project is to write a program that reads input data from a text file and creates a blockchain based on the provided data. All semester dates in the file are used to create blocks on the blockchain. A program will only accept a hash as valid if it meets certain conditions. Finally, the program will output the generated blockchain in a specific format.**Â 

# B. How to use this program 

- **Install the required blockchain libraries and dependencies.**
- **Creates a text file containing input data in the specified format.**
- **Run the blockchain program and provide the path to the text file as input.The program reads the input data from the file and creates blocks of dates for all semesters.**
- **The program accepts hashes as valid only if they meet the specified conditions. Finally, the program will output the generated blockchain in a specific format.**
